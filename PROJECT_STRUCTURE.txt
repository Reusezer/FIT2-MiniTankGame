Game Flow:
==========

1. User runs main.py
2. Game class initializes Pyxel window
3. MapGenerator creates random map
4. Players are spawned at corners
5. Game loop starts (30 FPS):
   - Update phase:
     * Read player inputs
     * Update player positions
     * Update bullets (movement, collision, reflection)
     * Update items (spawning, pickup)
     * Update mines (trigger detection)
     * Check win condition
   - Draw phase:
     * Clear screen
     * Draw map tiles
     * Draw items and mines
     * Draw bullets
     * Draw players with tracks
     * Draw explosions
     * Draw UI (scores, HP)
     * Draw game over screen if won

Key Features Implemented:
=========================
✓ 2D top-down tank combat
✓ Bullet reflection mechanics (4 mirror types)
✓ 5 power-up items with different effects
